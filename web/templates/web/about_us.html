    <h1>About Us</h1>

      At <strong>Doctify</strong>, our mission is to make healthcare accessible to everyone by connecting patients with the best doctors.

  <section class="about-why">
    <h2>Why We Built This App</h2>
    <p>
      The idea for <strong>Doctify</strong> was born out of a desire to address the gaps in the medical systems in the Dominican Republic. Many existing platforms are outdated and lack essential functionalities, making it difficult for patients to access the care they need and for doctors to manage their services efficiently. We aim to bridge this gap by providing a modern, user-friendly platform that simplifies the entire process.
